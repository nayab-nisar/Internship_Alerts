              At Ottawa Kabab, we are passionate about sharing the authentic tastes of the Middle East with our customers. Our story begins with our owner, Mamown Srdah, who grew up in Syria and has always had a deep love for the rich and complex flavors of his culture’s cuisine.

              In late 2021, Srdah took over Ottawa Kabab, which had previously been an Iraqi-owned restaurant. With his extensive knowledge of Syrian cuisine, Srdah set out to create a menu that showcased the best of his country’s dishes while also featuring Lebanese and Iraqi favorites.
              
              From our sizzling Iraqi kabab to our hand-crafted middle eastern appitizers, each dish is carefully crafted using traditional recipes passed down through generations. </div>
